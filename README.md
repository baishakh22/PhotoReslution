## Introduction
Enhancing image resolution plays a vital role in various applications, such as digital photography, medical imaging, surveillance systems, and more. This project aims to provide a simple and efficient solution for improving image quality using Python.

The script uses a combination of algorithms and techniques to upscale low-resolution images. It employs advanced interpolation methods, such as bicubic, Lanczos, or super-resolution techniques like deep learning-based algorithms, to generate images with higher resolution, improved details, and reduced artifacts.

## Requirements
To run the image resolution enhancement script, you need the following dependencies:

* Python 3.10
* NumPy
* OpenCV



## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-resolution-enhancement.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd PhotoResolution
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install pillow
```
This command will install the necessary Python packages.


## Usage
To enhance the resolution of an image, follow these steps:

1. Place your low-resolution image file (e.g., Matter.jpg) in the project directory.
2. Open a PyCharm IDE
3. Run the Python script
4. The script will process the image and save the enhanced version with increased resolution as **higher_res_image.jpg** in the project directory.

Feel free to experiment with different input images and adjust the parameters in the script to achieve the desired results.

## Examples
Here are some examples of enhanced images using the provided script:
